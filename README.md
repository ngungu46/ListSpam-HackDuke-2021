# ListSpam-HackDuke-2021
Project for HackDuke 2021

## SmartList is a platform that faciliatates communication and matching between event hosts and eventgoers, archieving a higher turnout rate for companies and higher satisfaction rate for attendees.

The SmartList platform allows organizations/companies to directly post events to the plateform at once, instead of going through the trouble of posting on multiple sites (Google Search, Evenbrite, Eventbrowse). In additions, we collect preferences from the users so that we can recommend events that best suit each user.

In the meantime, we add a layer of privacy protection by ananonymizing the users. Instead of putting your personal email to companies' subscription service, we will use an auto-generated email account to present you.

No more spams, only your dream opportunities to your inbox. All we need is who you are, all from one click. Fun!
